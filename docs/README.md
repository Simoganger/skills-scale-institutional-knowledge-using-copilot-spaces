# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README provides an overview of how projects are managed at OctoAcme and links to each of our living process documents.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme runs projects using an iterative, customer-first approach, emphasizing clear roles, measurable outcomes, and strong communication. Typical process phases:

1. **Initiation** – Validate the need, define stakeholders, set goals and success metrics, and produce a project one-pager.
2. **Planning** – Break work into increments, map dependencies/risks, estimate, and create a milestone-driven release plan.
3. **Execution & Tracking** – Follow regular team cadences, maintain a visible board, and ensure disciplined quality and reporting.
4. **Risk Management & Communication** – Proactively track, triage, and communicate risks and dependencies with stakeholders via standard templates.
5. **Release & Deployment** – Standardized checklists for safe delivery and rollbacks, with robust release notes and incident playbooks.
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** – Systematically gather learnings, prioritize action items, and track improvement over time.
7. **Roles & Personas** – Reference guide for typical responsibilities and expectations for team roles.
